# Cognitive Score Assessment and Improvement Tool
## Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to assess and improve cognitive scores using a combination of DSM-5 questionnaires and interactive tasks. The user journey begins with a landing page, where users can register or log in. They are then presented with a series of assessments, including four DSM-5 questionnaires and a 30-second snake game. Based on their performance, a baseline cognitive score is calculated and stored. Users are then directed to a dashboard where they can choose from various methods to improve their cognitive score, such as art therapy, meditation, green serenity, and community engagement. Finally, a report is generated to show the user's progress over time.
